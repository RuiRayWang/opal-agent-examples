## 4. colour Usage Guidelines

**Hierarchy:** Use primary colours for the most important elements to establish visual hierarchy. Secondary colours should support and enhance, not compete.

**Contrast:** Always ensure sufficient contrast between text and background colours for readability, especially for users with visual impairments. Utilize tools to check WCAG compliance.

**Consistency:** Apply colours consistently across all platforms and materials. This includes marketing collateral, product interfaces, presentations, and internal communications.

**Purposeful Application:** Every colour choice should be intentional and serve a purpose, whether it's to guide the user, highlight information, or evoke a specific emotion. Avoid arbitrary colour usage.

## 5. Accessibility Considerations

- Ensure a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for small text and 3:1 for large text (18pt or 14pt bold).
- Do not rely solely on colour to convey information. Use icons, text labels, or patterns as supplementary indicators.
- Test colour palettes under various conditions, including different screen types and lighting.
